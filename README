Swift is an Asterisk application module for using the Cepstral Swift Text-To-Speech (TTS) Engine in Asterisk.
You need to download and install one of the Cepstral Voices first. 
http://www.cepstral.com/downloads/
Voices are available for Mac OS-X, Linux, Windows and WindowsCE in several languages like
English, Spanish, German, French, Italian in professional quality for a very reasonable price (~30US$).
You can use all Voices in demo mode until you have a license.

Install one of the Cepstral Voices. Use the standard install directory /opt. 
On Linux don't forget to insert /opt/swift/lib into your /etc/ld.so.conf file and run ldconfig.
You can configure the voice for app_swift to use in swift.conf:
For example:

[general]
voice=Katrin

for the german female voice. If you comment out 'voice=' the standard voice is used.

In the app_sqfit directory run

make install

and load the module into Asterisk with

> load app_swift.so

done.

Usage in the dialplan:

[menu]
exten => s,1,Wait(2)  ; give it 2 seconds to open the line
exten => s,2,Swift(This text is going to get spoken by the Swift engine to the caller)
exten => s,3,Swift(You can press buttons on your keypad at any time)
exten => 1,1,Swift(You've pressed 1)
exten => 5,1,Swift(You've pressed 5)
exten => t,1,Swift(Anybody there?)
