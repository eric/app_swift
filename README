The beauty of this application is its ability to stream the
data from the text-to-speech engine vs. having to write out
and possibly convert audio files to the filesystem.

This release is specific to the Asterisk 1.6.x codebase and
will NOT work with the 1.4.x codebase. Please visit my site
for 1.4.x compatible releases.

For addition help, type 'core show application swift' on the
Asterisk command line interface.

Bug reports, comments, or otherwise can be directed to me at
dmsessions@gmail.com.
